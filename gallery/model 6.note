<p>The model shown above presents a more complex project with some electronic elements involved.</p>
<p>In this project, I began by creating a few sketches to lay the foundation for later surface modeling features. I discovered that modeling just half of the object with surfaces would yield the best results, so I initiated the process by constructing a lofted surface feature and then utilized these sketches to complete the surface.</p>
<p>The next step was converting these surfaces into a solid. To achieve this, I had to fill the missing faces with surfaces and make them solid. Subsequently, I performed routine tasks like mirroring, shelling, and utilizing the basic tools I had previously learned.</p>
<p>Another significant step involved splitting the solid using a split line. However, before doing so, I ensured that the sketches were tangent at the split line plane, ensuring the model's suitability for 3D printing.</p>
<p>Next, I decided to incorporate mounting bases and ribs for the inner structure. I also made a small cut on the ribs to accommodate the PCB board, which was a customized 3D printed board with holes for cable connections.</p>
<p>To ensure everything worked correctly, I made space in the upper part of the model for an LED diode and a button. For the button, I devised a mechanism to allow it to work freely while also minimizing excessive movement and ensuring it could reach the inner button on the PCB board.</p>
<p>The subsequent phase focused on the PCB board itself. I used a widely available schematic for a 555 timer and customized it to suit my needs using tools like Multisim. Once the electrical schematic was ready, I sketched on the PCB board some lines to create thick extrusions that would serve as wire channels.</p>
<p>As a finishing touch, I added a bottom switch for the battery to provide the option of turning off the device when not in use.</p>
<p>The entire process was both enjoyable and challenging. It encouraged me to think with purpose and underscored the importance of thoughtful design. This model also deepened my understanding of more intricate designs and how I can leverage the skills I've acquired thus far. I'm eagerly looking forward to tackling even more complex projects in the near future.</p>
